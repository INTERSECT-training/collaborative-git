## Glossary

- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **remote (repository)**: The copy of the repository on a remote server, such as GitHub. Accessible to anyone who has access to the repository on the server. Also referred to as the "central" repository.
- **local (repository)**: A copy of the repository in another place, such as a laptop or your home directory on a cluster. Generally accessible to one person.
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e).
- **branch**: Independent development line. The main development line is often called main or master.
- **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a commemorative plaque that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. phd-printed or paper-submitted).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one. This creates a local copy of the repository.
- **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your copy (fork) stays on GitHub/GitLab and you can make changes to your copy.
- **pull**: Bring changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- **push**: Bring changes from your local repository to the remote repository.
