To complete this lesson you must have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and have `git` installed on your laptop. Make sure you can authenticate into GitHub from your computer, either through `gh auth login`  or with [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). To use `gh auth login` you will need to first [install the gh command](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) and then authenticate using the instructions on the ([gh_auth_login page](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login)).
