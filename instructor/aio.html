<p>You may have used git for your own projects, but how can it be used
to work collaboratively on a software project?</p>
<p>There are a few challenges that come up when working on shared code.
We want to make sure everyone has access to and knows what is the latest
version, and we want to make sure everyone has an equal opportunity to
contribute. It can also be difficult to keep organized while code is
being actively developed and make sure everyone is on the same page
about the state of the code.</p>
<p>We can use sites like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and similar to share
code with others. These sites also enable teams to contribute to
software projects that they are working on together by hosting the code
in a centralized location that everyone has access to. This allows
everyone to view the latest version, and make updates as needed. It also
provides a mechanism for outside collaborators to contribute to the
project, say for open source software.</p>
<p>In this lesson we will be briefly going over some more advanced git
tools that become essential when working collaboratively. These are
branches and pull requests. In a collaborative environment, branches
allow more than one person to work on the code independently, separate
from the centralized main branch. Pull or merge requests provide a
transparent mechanism to bring the changes made on a branch into the
main branch, and encourage communication amongst the maintainers on
whether the changes should be pulled in or if further changes are
needed.</p>
<p>While technology helps, it is not the solution on its own. We will
also discuss git workflows, which describe the strategy of how branches
and pull requests should be used to stay organized and productive. We
will show a few common workflows, and give general guidance on how to
choose what will work well for your project and team.</p>
<p>Before diving in, we should review some basic terminology and
commands. Note that while other options are available, we are focusing
on GitHub for this lesson.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>repository (repo)</em>: The project, contains all data and
history (commits, branches, tags).</li>
<li>
<em>remote (repository)</em>: The copy of the repository on a remote
server, such as GitHub. Accessible to anyone who has access to the
repository on the server. Also referred to as the “central”
repository.</li>
<li>
<em>local (repository)</em>: A copy of the repository in another
place, such as a laptop or your home directory on a cluster. Generally
accessible to one person.</li>
<li>
<em>commit</em>: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier
(e.g. c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e).</li>
<li>
<em>branch</em>: Independent development line. The main development
line is often called main or master.</li>
<li>
<em>tag</em>: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it
later. Like a commemorative plaque that you attach to a particular
commit (e.g. phd-printed or paper-submitted).</li>
<li>
<em>clone</em>: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the
first time. This creates a local copy of the repository. “Clone” as a
noun refers to the local copy of the repository.</li>
<li>
<em>fork</em>: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not
yours) - your copy (fork) stays on GitHub/GitLab and you can make
changes to your copy. “Fork” as a noun refers to the your forked copy of
the repository.</li>
<li>
<em>pull</em>: Bring changes from a remote repository to your local
repository.</li>
<li>
<em>push</em>: Bring changes from your local repository to the
remote repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are adapted from <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/concepts/" class="external-link">Code
Refinery: Concepts around Collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>A note about git integrations: You may find that your IDE has git
built in allowing you to use the GUI instead of running the commands we
talk about here. In this lesson we are focusing on the command line git
commands, since they should be universal across any system you use.
After this lesson we encourage you to use what you are most comfortable
with, and the commands we cover will also help you better understand the
functionality of your IDE git integration.</p>

<p>Verify that you can access your GitHub account, have git installed on
your computer, and can authenticate with GitHub from your computer,

collaborate and then create a local clone with <code>git clone</code>.
We will use this repository for the remainder of the exercises in this

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Branches are independent development lines. Working independently,
you can likely get away with using git without creating any branches, as
in the first diagram in the figure below. However, when you begin to
work with others, branches allow team members to work on the code
without impacting the work of other developers or users.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/branches/branches.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>These graph diagrams show repositories with different numbers of
branches. The vertices, or circles, in these graphs show different
commits, and each horizontal path is a branch. The first shows a
repository with 1 main branch, the second a repository with 1 main and 1
feature branch, and the third repository 1 main and 2 feature
branches.</em></p>
<p>Branches can have a few different purposes. Branches created to
develop a specific feature are referred to as feature branches, and are
often short-lived. Branches can also be used for longer-term purposes,
such as having separate development and production branches. How you
organize and use branches in your project is referred to as a branching
strategy, which we will cover more when we talk about git workflows.</p>
<p>Changes made in one branch can be brought into another branch with a
merge. For example, when a feature branch is completed it may be merged
into the main branch. And, if while you are working on a feature branch
the main branch changes, you can merge the changes from the main branch
into your feature branch while you are still working.</p>

<p>You can create a branch on your local clone of the repository. If
didn’t just clone the repository it is always good to make sure you have
any recent changes to the main branch by checking out the main branch
and running “git pull”:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout main
git pull</code></pre>
<p>Then, to create a branch we can run:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout -b my_new_branch</code></pre>
<p>This will create the branch <code>my_new_branch</code> and move you
to the new branch. If you run <code>git status</code> at this point it
will display <code>On branch my_new_branch</code>. Making and committing
any changes will only update <code>my_new_branch</code>.</p>

<p><img src="../fig/branches/commit_branch.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>Every time you run the <code>git commit</code> command the

<p>If you need to switch to another existing branch you can use the
<code>git checkout</code> command. For example, to switch back to the
main branch you can run:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout main</code></pre>
<p>Remember, if you aren’t sure which branch you are on you can run
<code>git status</code>. It is good practice before you start making
changes to any of your files to check that you are on the right branch
with <code>git status</code>, particularly if you haven’t touched the
code recently.</p>

<h3 id="merging-branches">Merging Branches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merging-branches"></a>
</h3>
<p>Bring the changes from one branch into another branch by merging
them. When you merge branches, changes from the specified branch are
merged into the branch that you currently have checked out. For
example,</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout my_new_branch
git merge main</code></pre>
<p>will merge any changes introduced to <code>main</code> into the
<code>my_new_branch</code>. Merging in this direction is especially
useful when you’ve been working on <code>my_new_branch</code> for a
while and <code>main</code> has changed in the meantime.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/branches/merge_into_branch.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>Merging new commits from the main branch into the feature
branch with <code>git merge main</code>.</em></p>
<p>When development is complete on <code>my_new_branch</code>, it would
be merged into <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout main
git merge my_new_branch</code></pre>
<p><img src="../fig/branches/merge_into_main.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>Merging new commits the feature branch into the main
branch with <code>git merge my_branch</code>.</em></p>
<p>Git will do its best to complete the merge automatically. For
example, if none of the changes have happened in the same lines of code,
things will usually merge cleanly. If the merge can’t complete
automatically, this is called a merge conflict. Any conflicts in the
files must be resolved before the merge can be completed.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="merge-vs-rebase">Merge vs Rebase<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#merge-vs-rebase"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There is another way to introduce changes from one branch to another:
rebasing. A rebase rewrites history. For example, if there are new
commits on the main branch while you are working on a feature branch,
you could merge those commits into your feature branch, as we describe
above. This creates a new commit with two parent commits: one in your
feature branch, one in the main branch. Alternatively, you can rebase
your feature branch onto the new end of the main branch with
<code>git rebase main</code>. Rebasing “replays” your feature branch
commits onto the new commits of the main branch, as if you started your
branch there.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/branches/rebase.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>Rebasing the feature branch onto new commits in the main branch with
<code>git rebase main</code>.</em></p>
<p>Rebasing creates a cleaner history, without the extra merge commit.
However, rebases never be done on public branches that others might be
using or even looking at. It will result in your repository and everyone
else’s having different history, which can be confusing and difficult to
fix. If no one else is looking at your branch, especially if you haven’t
published it yet, rebasing is safe.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>A Pull Request is a GitHub a process to request that a branch be
merged into another branch. It’s called a “Pull Request” because you are
requesting that the change introduced be pulled into the other branch.
In GitLab it is called a “Merge Request”. Pull requests provide a
process and an opportunity for code review before merging branches you
don’t own or manage by yourself, such as the main branch. They can also
be a mechanism for proposing and discussing changes, and requesting
additional changes be made before the branch is merged.</p>

<p>First, make sure you don’t have any commits you haven’t pushed to
GitHub. Go to your local repository and run <code>git status</code>. If
you have any commits you haven’t yet pushed, push them now with
<code>git push</code>. Remember, if you haven’t pushed from this branch
to the remote repository yet, you will be prompted to publish your
branch with
<code>git push --set-upstream origin my_new_branch</code>.</p>
<p>Now navigate to your branch in GitHub. If you’ve pushed any commits
recently you may see a callout that says your branch has recent pushes
and provides a button that says “Compare and Pull Request”. Pressing
this will bring you to the form to create your Pull Request to the main
branch. If you don’t have this button, you can select “Pull Requests” at
the top of the page and select “New Pull Request”. From there select
your branch under the “compare” dropdown. If you would like to merge
your branch into a branch other than main, select that branch under the
“base” dropdown. Then select “Create Pull Request”.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/pr/01_gotobranch.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>Creating a Pull Request: If you recently pushed changes to your
branch you may see a button that says “Compare and Pull Request” on

<p>At this point you will see a form. Fill out the form with a title and
description for the Pull Request, and then click “Create Pull Request”.
We will go more in depth on how to make good pull requests in a later
section.</p>

<p>Once the Pull Request is created there are a few different tabs on
the page. The first is the conversation tab, which shows a timeline of
comments and commits, starting with the initial description that you
gave when creating the Pull Request. At the bottom will be a box that
shows the result of any Continuous Integration that has been defined,
such as automated tests (the one in the image doesn’t have any set up),
as well as whether there are any merge conflicts for the Pull
Request.</p>
<p><img src="../fig/pr/03_conversation.png" style="width:75.0%" alt="" class="figure"><em>The conversation tab of a Pull Request.</em></p>
<p>At the very bottom of the page is a box where you can leave a

your comment.</p>

<p>There is also a tab that shows all the commits in the Pull Request
(the Commits tab). The last Files Changed tab shows the diff between the
base branch and the Pull Request branch. This is useful in reviewing the
Pull Request, and it allows you to leave in-line comments. If you see a
line of code that needs to be updated or changed, you can click the +
next to that line to leave a comment.</p>

<p>Once the Pull Request is created you and anyone with access to the
repository can make comments on the request. These comments might be
clarifying questions or requests for additional changes. If additional
changes are needed, make those changes in your branch and push them. The
commits will be added to the Pull Request automatically and appear on
the main Conversation page.</p>

<p>Once a Pull Request has been reviewed and ready to be accepted, it
can be merged. First verify that the branch has no conflicts with the
base branch (the one that will be merged into). Any conflicts should be
addressed with additional commits. When ready to merge, click “Merge
Pull Request”, then click “Confirm merge”. You will be given the option
to delete the branch. Whether you delete the branch depends on its
purpose and how you and your group want to handle branches that have
been merged. Deleting feature branches helps keep clutter down and makes
it easier to find relevant branches. However, if you have any longer
term branches, such as a development or production branch, you wouldn’t
want to delete that.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>When you are working with others in the same git repository, you’ll
find you’ll need to come to an agreement on how you are going to work in
the repository. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you are going to use branches</li>
<li>What is considered the “latest version”, or what is “production” vs
“in development”</li>
<li>How those branches are merged</li>
<li>When you are making pull requests and into what</li>
<li>Whether you are working in a single, central repository, or separate
forked repositories</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are often answered by what we will call a git
workflow. A git workflow helps you keep organized when working on a
team, helps everyone stay on the same page about the state of the code,
and helps enable communication. If you’ve ever emailed around documents
you were working on with a team, you might understand the value of
everyone on the team always having access to both the latest version,
and any material still in progress.</p>
<p>When we talk about git workflows often we are really discussing is
branching strategies. The branching strategy is how you are going to use
branches to work with the code. This includes the purposes of each
branch (ex: a feature branch vs a release branch), where a new branch is
created, and how, when, and where branches are merged. Different
branches and branch types will have different lifetimes as well. For
example, once a feature branch has been merged it can often be deleted,
however a dedicated development branch might exist for the entire
project.</p>
<p>The git workflow should also dictate what is stable under what
conditions, what is tested, and may also include testing strategies.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="some-common-workflows">Some Common Workflows<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#some-common-workflows"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are a few common workflows that are talked about the most. One
might be better in some cases, another in others, but no one is
necessarily the best in every case than any of the others. There will
likely be one that best fits your application and your team’s goals, but
you may find you will still need to make adjustments, and that is
okay.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="centralized-or-truck-based-workflow">Centralized or Truck-Based Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#centralized-or-truck-based-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>With a centralized workflow you only have one main branch (or trunk,
borrowing terminology from SVN, another version control system). Team
members work in their local clone and push commits less frequently. The
central repository is meant to be “clean” and should be stable. Git will
also prevent you from pushing any changes that cause conflicts. If
someone else as pushed a change that conflicts with one of your local
commits, git will not let you push those changes and will require you
resolve the conflict locally before pushing.</p>
<p>A centralized workflow with a single main branch is not the best for
collaborative development, although it may work okay in small teams. We
mention it to give a name to a process you might already be familiar
with, and as a starting point for other workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="feature-branching-workflows-and-github-flow">Feature Branching Workflows and GitHub Flow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-branching-workflows-and-github-flow"></a>
</h3>
<p>Since we’ve covered branching, a simple extension to the centralized
workflow is a Feature Branching Workflow. The main branch is like the
central repository in the centralized workflow, it is meant to be clean
and stable. Instead in working directly in clones of the main branch,
all development is done in feature branches, where each branch is
created from the main branch to develop a specific feature. The branch
is published soon after it is created in the remote repository and
commits are regularly pushed. This allows other developers to see the
branch and any changes early. Using feature branches also allows an
individual developer to work on more than one feature at a time if
needed. Say you are working on developing a feature that requires some
time and thought, but in the process find a bug that should be fixed
immediately. You can create a new branch, fix the bug, and merge it back
into the main branch without introducing any of the partially developed
code you are still working on in the other feature branch.</p>
<p>Once the feature is complete and tested, feature branches are merged
back into the main branch through Pull Requests. Any merge conflicts
should be handled in the feature branch before merging. This can be done
by merging any new commits from the main branch into the feature branch,
handling any conflicts that emerge. The changes are discussed and
reviewed in the Pull Request, and once accepted hey are merged. Once
merged, the lifecycle of a feature branch is general complete and it can
be deleted if it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>This is also known as “GitHub Flow”, as it is used by the developers
of GitHub for sections of their website, including their documentation.
GitHub even has a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow" class="external-link">dedicated
page in their documentation</a> describing the workflow. It is most
useful for projects that have a rolling development cycle without
specific versioned releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-flow">Git Flow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-flow"></a>
</h3>
<p>Git Flow is one of the most commonly used workflows. It is used for
software projects that require robust, production-ready releases. It is
suitable for larger teams where more than one person might work on the
same feature.</p>
<p>Git Flow builds on a feature branching workflow, where instead of
creating feature branches from the main branch, they are created from a
separate permanent development branch. When a feature is complete, its
branch is merged into the development branch. Individual release
branches are created from the development branch, and once
production-ready are merged into the main branch upon release and
tagged. The main branch therefore contains only fully tested, stable,
production code associated with a particular version. If the code has a
bug in the main branch that needs to be fixed immediately, hotfix
branches can be created off the main branched and merged directly back
into the main branch without being added to the development branch or a
release branch.</p>
<p>Git Flow was introduced with a blog post in 2010, which you can see
<a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" class="external-link">here</a>
if you are interested.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="gitlab-flow">GitLab Flow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gitlab-flow"></a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to GitHub Flow, GitLab Flow gets its name because it is the
workflow used by GitLab. GitLab is a bit closer to the simplicity of
GitHub Flow, but is more appropriate in cases where the rolling releases
of GitHub Flow are not possible. GitLab Flow is similar to Git Flow in
that feature branches are not merged directly into the production
branch, however instead it has a separate named production branch and
the feature branches are merged into the main branch, which is more like
the development branch of Git Flow. Release branches are optional, and
only recommended only when software is released to the outside
world.</p>
<p>For more information, see GitLab’s article on <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html" class="external-link">GitLab
Flow</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="forking-workflows">Forking Workflows<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#forking-workflows"></a>
</h3>
<p>In each of these example workflows we have assumed that anyone
contributing to a repository has the ability to directly push commits to
a repository. However, sometimes you want to enable developers to
contribute to a project without giving them access to the repository
itself. In this case, a forking workflow might be suitable. Any of the
workflows we’ve talked about already could incorporate forking. With a
forking workflow individual developers create their own fork of a
repository and do their development within their fork. When a feature is
complete, the developer creates a Pull Request into the appropriate
branch of the original repository. The owners of the repository can then
approve the Pull Request at their discretion. This is how many open
source projects encourage contributions.</p>
<p>With a forking workflow it can be easy to end up with an old version
of the code, especially if it changes frequently. It can get confusing
whether we are attempting to pull from or push to the fork or the
original repository. Setting up remotes with easy to remember aliases
makes this much easier. A “remote” is a named connection to a remote
repository. You can add and remove remotes with the
<code>git remote add</code> and <code>git remote rm</code> commands,
respectively. For example:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/project_team/project.git
git remote add my-fork https://github.com/me/project.git</code></pre>
<p>Here we are adding a remote called “upstream” for our central team
repository and another called “my-fork” for our own fork. We can view
our remotes with <code>git remote -v</code>. Now when you want to
retrieve any changes from the upstream repository you can run
<code>git fetch upstream</code>. To update your main branch with these
changes, you would merge them into your local forked repository:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git checkout main # this is the main branch for your fork that you have cloned locally
git merge upstream/main</code></pre>
<p>Using remotes, fetching and merging upstream changes frequently, and
running commands like <code>git status</code> and
<code>git remote -v</code> can help you be successful using a forking
workflow. Merging upstream changes directly before making a Pull Request
and ensuring there are no merge conflicts is good etiquette and will
make it more likely that your Pull Request will be accepted.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now that you’ve chosen a workflow for your project, how do you
communicate it? This is most often done with a CONTRIBUTING document.
The CONTRIBUTING document describes the git workflow you are using, any
conventions for branch naming that you have, and anything else a
collaborator should know in order to contribute. It should be tailored
to your project and team, and so it might also include how to run the
tests for the project, requirements before creating Pull Requests, or
perhaps detailed instructions for how follow the workflow if your team
is less familiar with git. One of the goals of a CONTRIBUTING document
is to lower the barrier to entry to contributing to a project and a good
one will encourage collaboration.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="enforcing-your-workflow">Enforcing your Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#enforcing-your-workflow"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are tools that you can use to make sure everyone follows the
agreed upon workflow, which can make it easier to collaborate with
others. First, you can add branch protections, which will enforce
certain rules for certain branches. A common one is to not allow commits
directly to the main branch, requiring changes to go through a Pull
Request. There are many options for branch protection that you can read
about on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches" class="external-link">GitHub
web page</a>. Similarly, you can limit who on the team is able to push
or merge changes into a particular branch, or in the entire repository.
It is also a good idea to have testing and review requirements,
particularly for production branches. These requirements and branch
protections should be documented in the CONTRIBUTING document as
well.</p>
<p>We will end with a quick note if your team works on shared systems,
including clusters and HPC systems. Be careful with clones on shared
drives, you never want to share a cloned repository. Each person should
work within their own clone. You might also consider having additional
“production” clone that is used for running. No one edits the production
clone directly, it is only updated by pulling changes from the
repository.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="activity">Activity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#activity"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>For your group’s “project” that you have been working on through this
lesson discuss which workflow would work best for your team. Set up the
repository as needed to support this workflow. Start a contributor guide
that explains the workflow and any rules for contributing.</p>
<p>If time allows, discuss any projects that your group members work on
collaboratively with others. Is there a specified workflow for this
project? How would someone contribute to the project?</p>
